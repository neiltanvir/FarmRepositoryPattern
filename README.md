# FarmRepositoryPattern
The Farm Repository Pattern is a design approach divided into two layers: the Data Access Layer (DAL) and the Business Layer. The DAL manages interactions with the data storage, providing CRUD operations and abstracting storage specifics. In contrast, the Business Layer contains the core application logic, relying on the DAL for data access and focusing on business rules, validation, and orchestration. This separation simplifies maintenance, testing, and adaptability by isolating data-related tasks from business logic, enabling flexibility when dealing with changes in data storage or business requirements.
